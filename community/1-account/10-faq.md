## Can I sign up for multiple accounts?

Yes, you can! Simply sign up following the same registration flow.

## How long does it take to open an account?

Once all the required documents are provided, we'll swiftly approve, validate, and get your account up and running within 1-2 business days.

However, if there are any incorrect, missing, or expired documents, the account opening process may take up to 5 business days.

But don't fret! You can still register and log in to the Paymennt.com mobile app immediately to start exploring and familiarizing yourself with the platform.

Just keep in mind that you won't be able to use our payment-related services until all the necessary documents are received and your account has been verified. We appreciate your understanding!

## Do I need to sign a physical contract?

No physical contact is required if you register via the Paymennt.com mobile app. During registration, you'll digitally agree to our Pricing Plan, Terms and Conditions, and Privacy Notice. It's all done seamlessly within the app!

## Can I sign up with a personal bank account?

For businesses with 100% ownership, you're welcome to sign up using your personal bank account. However, if your business has multiple owners or stakeholders, you'll need to use a business bank account for sign-up.

## What are KYC and KYB?

KYC is the process that is used to verify the identity of our customers. It involves collecting information such as government-issued ID, address proof, and other relevant documents to confirm the identity of an individual. KYC helps to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities by ensuring that we are dealing with legitimate customers.

KYB is similar to KYC but focuses on understanding the nature of a business rather than an individual. This process involves collecting information about the business, its ownership structure, key stakeholders, industry, and other relevant details. KYB helps us assess the risk associated with engaging in transactions with a particular business entity and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Is Card-on-file a must to provide?

Yes, providing a Card-on-file is mandatory to ensure you have sufficient funds to use our service and to prevent account freezing. Fees will only be deducted from your payment card if the account balance is insufficient to cover the plan fee and payment device subscription fee.
